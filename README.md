One-Stop-Shop Fitness Guide for Beginners

My audience is simply everyone. Fitness either plays, can play, or should play a vital role in everyone's life. They're six different types of health, and every person on this planet should strive to improve all six different types to improve both their quality of life and the quality of life for others around.

Maintaining a healthy fitness schedule is hard enough, but Covid-19 has made it even more difficult by either closing gyms or making gyms a place where people are afraid to go. So how does one stay in shape at home? Or if one does brave the gym, how can they stay safe? 

I want to create a web application aimed at beginners ready to start a fitness journey, equipped with information needed to stay safe during Covid-19. However, my web application will be for fitness fanatics everywhere, with tools they can take advantage of.

Hello everyone! My name is Jonathon White, but feel free to call me J.D. I have a diverse background, including emergency medicine, sales and customer support, and human capital management informatics. Recently, however, I have decided to more aggressively pursue a career in my current graduate program, computer science. While I am gaining a thorough understanding of the mathematics and algorithmic approach of the field, I joined SavvyCoders to accumulate the hard skills necessary for an entry-level software developer position. 

Fitness has always played an important role in my life, both professionally and personally, and it is common knowledge that Covid-19 hit the fitness world hard. Therefore, I decided as a certified personal trainer to create an environment suited for beginners and experienced fitness-lovers alike, aimed at staying healthy during the time of Covid-19 and the restrictions it brings on life. This includes various at-home workouts for a variety of fitness levels, staying safe at fitness gyms when returning, and various personal physiological calculators to help keep track of diet and goals. Fitness is a way to fight illness, and I plan to do my share in fighting Covid-19.
